# Music App

## Experience:
### Before I just want to try this app when I watched YouTuber kds_coder's one of videos, amonging developing the project, I have many words to share. 
### First of all, browser problem is my first point to say, due to I don't know CSS's persudo class -webkit-scrollbar just support for Chrome or other browser, in all it cant support Firefox so my scrollbar always cant hidden or none. In the end, I google this problem and found a result in [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com)

## Lack:
### Currently my project cant support in China mainland due to icons problem, in the future I will try to address it maybe passing by change icons providers like [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com).
### Secondly due to time limitation I don't guarantee ecery picture is unique so you can replace your favorite picture after you forked it.
### Thirdly, the playlist cant continue playing when one song was ended and other problem about icon replacement.
### It cant support for mobile phone and need to restyle the layout.
